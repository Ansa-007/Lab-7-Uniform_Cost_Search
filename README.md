# Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) Implementation

## Overview

This comprehensive lab explores Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a starting node to a goal node in weighted graphs. UCS is particularly valuable in industry applications where path costs vary and optimal solutions are critical.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand UCS theoretical foundations and mathematical properties
- Implement efficient UCS using priority queues
- Apply UCS to real-world optimization problems

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from uniform_cost_search import UniformCostSearch, Graph

# Create a graph
graph = Graph()
graph.add_edge('A', 'B', cost=5)
graph.add_edge('B', 'C', cost=3)
graph.add_edge('A', 'C', cost=10)

# Run UCS
ucs = UniformCostSearch(graph)
path, cost = ucs.search('A', 'C')
print(f"Path: {path}, Cost: {cost}")
```

## Industry Case Studies

1. **Network Routing**: OSPF protocol implementation
2. **Logistics Optimization**: Delivery route planning
3. **Resource Management**: Cloud computing resource allocation
4. **Transportation**: Urban traffic flow optimization

## Performance Benchmarks

- Time complexity: O(b^(1+C*/ε)) where b is branching factor, C* is optimal solution cost, ε is minimum step cost
- Space complexity: O(b^(1+C*/ε))
- Optimality: Guaranteed to find least-cost path
